TODO

DiffDetective takes a preprocessor-based software product line repository and matches edit patterns in its commit history.
It can detect an extensible variety of different edit patterns and reverse engineers feature contexts known from feature trace recording.
The output of the tool consists of all pattern matches found and different metrics relevant for the evaluation of feature trace recording.
