These are the numbers how often each pattern occured.

Some things to note:
1. Some patterns exist in other shapes, too
   (e.g., AddIfdefElif with further elif cases or MoveElse with the else's swapped).
   So when just searching for exact copies of the patterns here, we expect less matches.
2. We operate on a filtered variant of the original dataset, so we expect less matches in total.
3. Roots were relabeled to IF.

Pattern          | #trees with at least | #matches
                 | one occurence        |
---------------------------------------------------
AddIfdefElse     |                  309 |       743
AddIfdefElif     |                   72 |       111
AddIfdefWrapElse |                   64 |        87
AddIfdefWrapThen |                   47 |        56
MoveElse         |                    4 |         6
